## EE551 final project proposal

This project is to build a game named My snake. This puzzle game is very simple, through the keyboard user can control the direction of the snake to eat eggs. The more eggs the snake eats, the higher scores users can get. This project will also include game background, the record of highest score, welcome interface and  user interface. That will provide a nice game experience.
